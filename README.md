Annotation_corpus.py is the python programme that helps to test any raw corpus or individual decision. The user must pass one project and one model as the other two arguments. 
That programme uses the call_sherpa function from Kairntech API.
It requires a login and a password that should be obtained from the company (contact@kairntech.com)
Individual manually-annotated decisions are available in the Simulated examples directory.
They have been tested with different models. Looking at them allows to figure out how obtained annotations may differ from expected ones.
Full corpora may be requested to me through my Linkedin profile : https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-mathis-5274086/
Raw or annotated non-pseudonymized corpora are not available.
